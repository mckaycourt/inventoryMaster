            <h2>First Book</h2>
            <p>When the Book of Abraham was first published to the world in 1842, it was published as “a translation of
                some ancient records that have fallen into [Joseph Smith’s] hands from the catacombs of Egypt,
                purporting to be the writings of Abraham while he was in Egypt, called ‘The Book of Abraham, Written by
                his Own Hand, upon Papyrus.’” The resultant record was thus connected with the papyri once owned by
                Joseph Smith, though which papyrus of the four or five in his possession was never specified.</p>

            <h2>Second Book</h2>
            <p>While Jesus and his disciples were at or near Caesarea Philippi, Peter testified that Jesus was “the
                Christ, the Son of the living God.” Martha had a similar divine testimony, proclaiming, “I believe that
                thou art the Christ, the Son of God.” In much the same way, a standard part of Latter-day Saint
                discourse includes bearing testimony that “Jesus is the Christ,” but what do we mean when we say that
                Jesus is the Christ?</p>

            <p>Two nineteenth-century men, Alexander Campbell and Joseph Smith, each launched restoration movements in
                the United States. They vied for seekers and dissatisfied mainstream Christians, which led to conflict
                in northeastern Ohio. Both were searching for the primordial beginning of Christianity: Campbell looking
                back to the Christian church described in the New Testament epistles, and Smith looking even further
                back to the time of Adam and Eve as the first Christians.</p>

            <p>Under the guidance of some of the best thinkers on the Book of Mormon, the Abinadi narrative springs to
                life as each chapter approaches Abinadi’s story and words from a different perspective. Whether viewed
                through a sociopolitical, literary, theological, philosophical, or historical lens, new insights and a
                new appreciation for the richness of Abinadi’s discourse will help readers reignite their passion for
                the beauty and depth of the Book of Mormon.</p>
